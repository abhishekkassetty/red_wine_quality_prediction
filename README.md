# red_wine_quality_prediction
Prediction the quality of wine
● Collected Data from UCI Machine Learning repository .
link to dataset:
              https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
● Preprocessed the data and visualised the data with the help of python libraries.
● Trained the data with different kernels of SVM algorithm and did the analysis of different kernels .
              1.Linear kernal
              2.Polynomial kernal
              3.RBF(radial basis function) kernal
              4.sigmoid kernal
● Did Both Classification and Regression on quality of wine and saved the model using pickle
● Using Flask frame work created web api and Deployed in server(only for learning how to deploy).
